    # If a word contains a blocked word, and is less long than this value multiplied by the
    #  length of the blocked word, the word will still get blocked.
    # For example, a multiplier of 2 will block "fuckwit" if "fuck" is blocked, but not
    #  "fucktard".
    # Lower values will reduce the chance of false-positives, but require you to put more
    #  swear-words containing smaller swear words in the swearlist.txt (makes the process
    #  longer.
    # Higher values mean you can skip adding words such as "fucktard" to swearlist.txt if you
    #  have blocked the word "fuck" and have a multiplier higher than 2, making the process
    #  faster.
    # Minimum value of 1.
