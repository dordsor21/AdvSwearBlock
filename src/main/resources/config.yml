    # If a word contains a blocked word, and the length is less than or equal to this value

    #  "fucktards".
    # Lower values will reduce the chance of false-positives, but require you to put more
    #  swear-words containing smaller swear words in the swearlist.yml (makes the process
    #  longer.
    # Higher values mean you can skip adding words such as "fucktard" to swearlist.yml if you
    #  have blocked the word "fuck" and have a multiplier of 2 or higher, making the process
